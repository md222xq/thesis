      "raw_response": "  Rating: VULNERABLE\nVulnerability Type: Reentrancy\n\nThe smart contract is vulnerable to reentrancy due to the use of a public function that can be called by anyone. The `changeOwner` function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the new owner has malicious intentions. Additionally, the use of a public payable function without any access control or restrictions can also lead to denial of service attacks or other types of attacks.\n\nIt is recommended to make the `changeOwner` function private and only accessible by the current owner of the contract. Additionally, it would be a good practice to use access control mechanisms such as modifiers or roles to restrict access to sensitive functions."
