  "analysis": {
    "Rating": "AVOID",
    "Reason": "The smart contract has potential security vulnerabilities. Within the withdrawBalance() function, the call() function is used, which can have reentrancy risks. Moreover, the function addToBalance() lacks safemath protection, it checks the overflow after the operation, which can lead to potential attacks."

  "analysis": {
    "Rating": "AVOID",
    "Reason": "This contract is unsafe because it has seems to exhibit a re-entrancy vulnerability through the withdrawBalance function. The function allows for external calls before deleting or updating the balance, opening an opportunity for a re-entrant attack."

  "file_path": "./Contracts/Decompiled/Dedaub\\04_Dedaub_reentrancy.sol",
  "analysis": {
    "Rating": "AVOID",

{
  "file_path": "./Contracts/Decompiled/Dedaub\\05_Dedaub_randomnumber.sol",
  "analysis": {
    "Rating": "AVOID",
    "Reason": "The smart contract seems to contain high risk functionality. Specifically, the 'guess' function can initiate calls to arbitrary addresses without checks and the fallback function will always reject incoming transactions. Also, contract uses low-level calls (msg.sender.call()) which can be prone to reentrancy attacks."

  "analysis": {
    "rating": "AVOID",
    "reason": "The smart contract uses a low-level opcode 'RETURNDATACOPY', and directly manipulates the memory. These factors suggest that the contract might be attempting obfuscation, making audit difficult and questionable behaviour hard to spot. As a rule, always avoid smart contracts that utilise low-level opcodes especially in complex patterns."

{
  "file_path": "./Contracts/Decompiled/Dedaub\\11_Dedaub_delegate_call.sol",
  "analysis": {
    "Rating": "AVOID",
    "Reason": "The smart contract contains a delegatecall function which can potentially enable a third party contract to take over. This can represent a serious security risk as it could be used for malicious purposes. Delegatecall functions should be used with extreme caution and the smart contracts they interact with should be carefully vetted."
