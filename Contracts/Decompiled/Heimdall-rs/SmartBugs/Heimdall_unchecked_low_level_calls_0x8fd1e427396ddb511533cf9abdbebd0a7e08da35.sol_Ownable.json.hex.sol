/// @notice           This contract was decompiled using the heimdall-rs decompiler.
///                     It was generated directly by tracing the EVM opcodes from this contract.
///                     As a result, it may not compile or even be valid solidity code.
///                     Despite this, it should be obvious what each function does. Overall
///                     logic should have been preserved throughout decompiling.

/// @custom:github    You can find the open-source decompiler here:
